### CYCLE GAN

![Cycle GAN]()
The CycleGAN consists of two main parts: the Generators (CycleGenerator) and the Discriminators.
Generators:

There are two generators: 
𝐺
G (transforms images from domain X to domain Y) and 
𝐹
F (transforms images from domain Y to domain X).
Encoder Part of Generators:

The encoder part of the CycleGenerator uses a series of ConvBlocks to progressively reduce the spatial dimensions of the input image while increasing the number of feature channels.
ConvBlocks:

Each ConvBlock consists of a convolutional layer followed by batch normalization (optional) and a ReLU activation function (optional).
ResNet Part of Generators:

The central part of the CycleGenerator uses a series of ResidualBlocks. Each ResidualBlock consists of two ConvBlocks and includes a skip connection that adds the input to the output of the block.
Decoder Part of Generators:

The decoder part of the CycleGenerator uses DeconvBlocks (deconvolutional layers) to progressively increase the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while reducing the number of feature channels back to that of the input image.
DeconvBlocks:

Each DeconvBlock consists of a ConvTranspose2d layer followed by batch normalization (optional) and a ReLU activation function (optional).
Final Layer of Generators:

The last layer of the CycleGenerator is a ConvTranspose2d layer followed by a Tanh activation function to produce the final output image.
Discriminators:

There are two discriminators: 
𝐷
𝑋
D 
X
​
  (distinguishes between real images from domain X and fake images generated by 
𝐹
F) and 
𝐷
𝑌
D 
Y
​
  (distinguishes between real images from domain Y and fake images generated by 
𝐺
G).
Discriminator Architecture:

Each discriminator consists of a series of ConvBlocks with increasing feature dimensions. The last ConvBlock produces a single output value indicating whether the input image is real or fake.
